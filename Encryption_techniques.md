# Encryption Techniques
## Learning Objectives
- Understand cryptography basics
- Differentiate between symmetric and assymetric encryption
- Learn hashing and digital signature concepts

## Cryptography
Cryptograpgy is a trechnique of securing information and communications using codes to ensure confidentiality
 ## Symmetric Encryption
- Uses one key for both encruption and decryption.
- Fast, suaitable for bulk data encryption.

## Asymmertric Encryption
- Uses two keys: Public Key (for encryption) & Private Key (for decryption).
- Used for secure key exchabnge and digital communication.

## Hashing
- Converts data into a fixed-length string.
- One-way process- cannot be reversed.
- Useed for password storage adn integrity checking.
- Common Algorithms: SHA-256, MDs (deprecated)

  ## Digital Signatures and Certificates
  - Ensure authenticity and non-repudiation.
  - A digital signature uses private key to sign data and public key to verify.
  - Certificate (X.509) are issued by Certification Authorities (CAs) for trust verification (used in HTTPS)

  ## Examples:
  When visiting https://bank.com
  - browser verifies certificates signed by CA to ensure authencity.
