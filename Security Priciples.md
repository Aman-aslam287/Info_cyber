# Learning Objectives
- Understand the CIA Trial and its importance
- Explaiin Risk,Privacy, and Accountability
- Relate Secutrity principles to real world cyber incidents

# CIA Trials
- The CIA Trial form the foundation of information security
- Each element ensures that information remain safe and trustworthy

|Element             |Description                                                  |Example                                                   |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Confodentiality**| Ensures data is accessible only to authoised users.         | Encrypting files, using passwords, accedss control lists.|
| **Integrity**      | Ensures data is accurate, consistent and not tampered with. | Using hashings, digital signatures, checksums.           |
| **Availability**   | Ensures systems and data are available when needed.         | Redundant servers, backups, DDos protection.             |

# Key Concepts
- Data breaches often occurs when one or more CIA principles are compromised.
- Balance is key - too much focus on one (e.g., availability) can weaken another (e.g., confidentiality).
# Examples
- **Confidentiality Violation** Unauthorized access to customer data (e.g., confidentiality).
- **Integrity Violation** Tampered medical data in hospitals leading to misdiagnosis.
- **Availability Violation** DDos attack on banking websites oreventing service access.

# Risk, Privacy and Accountability
## Risk
- Definition- Probability of a threat exploitingh a vulnerability to cause harm.

## Components:
- Threat - something that can cause damage.
- Vulnerability - weakmess that can be exploited.
- Impact - damage if threat is realized.

## Formula:
- Risk = Threat x Vulnerability x Impact

## Examples:
- Threat - Phishing
- Vulnerability - Employee lack of awareness
- Impact - Credential theft, financial loss

## Privacy
- Protecting personel and sensitive information of individuals.
- Governed by laws like GDPR, DPDP Act(India), HIPAA

## Key Practices
- Data minimization
- Informed consent
- Data anonmymization
Example: A Healthcare app must not share user helath data without consent

## Accountability
Ensuring every action in an IT system can be traced back to an individual
## Achieved Through: 
- Logging & auditing
- User access tracking
- Non-repudiation mechanisms
Example: Audit logs in firewalls to trace malicious user actions.
